# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains two key projects focused on data analysis and ETL processes using AWS services. Both projects demonstrate various stages of data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), data governance, and the use of visualization tools. The first project deals with the property tax data of the City of Vancouver, while the second project involves analyzing professional development data for the UCW HR Office.
